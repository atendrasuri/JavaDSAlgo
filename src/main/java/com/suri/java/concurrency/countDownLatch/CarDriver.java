 * <p>
 * <p>
 * CountDown Latch in Java Concurrency is a type of synchronizer which allows one Thread wait for one or more Threads before it starts processing.
 * <p>
 * CountDown Latch is useful if you want to start main processing threads once its dependency is completed.
 * <p>
 * In this example, Car can start only after all 4 employees take their seat in the car.
